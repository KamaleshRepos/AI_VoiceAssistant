# AI Voice Assistant for Room Temperature Control  

This project is an AI-powered voice assistant designed to enhance home automation by managing room temperature. It can:  
1. **Monitor the current room temperature** using connected sensors.  
2. **Control the temperature** by enabling users to increase or decrease it via voice commands.  

The system integrates a **LiveKit server** for real-time communication and uses **OpenAI's API** to process natural language inputs and generate intelligent responses.
